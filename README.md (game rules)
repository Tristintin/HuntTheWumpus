RULES:
1. There are three hazards: A bottomless pit, a colony of four bats, and a wumpus.
	a. When in a room next to the pit, you will feel a breeze.
	b. When in a room next to the wumpus, you will smell its rancid stench.
	c. When in a room next to a bat, you will hear its shrieks.
	d. If you walk into a room with a bat, it will first lift you up and drop you in a random empty location, then move to another empty room itself.
2. The wumpus cannot be lifted by the bats and cannot be killed by the pit.
3. You are able to move or shoot, but only into one of the three rooms that are adjacent to you at any point in time. 
4. You are armed with five arrows at the start of the game; if you run out of arrows and the wumpus is still alive, it is game over for you. 
5. Firing an arrow close enough to the wumpus and missing it may cause it to move to one of its adjacent rooms; it is possible that it will move to your current location and kill you.
