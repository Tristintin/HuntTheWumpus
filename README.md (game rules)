RULES:
1. There are four types of hazards: Two rooms which will inflict you with either loss of hearing or smell, a bottomless pit, a colony of four bats, and two Wumpi.
	a. When in a room next to the pit, you will feel a breeze.
	b. When in a room next to a Wumpus, you will smell its rancid stench.
	c. When in a room next to a bat, you will hear its shrieks.
	d. If you walk into a room with a bat, it will first lift you up and drop you in a random empty location, then move to another empty room itself.
	e. If you walk into a room which inflicts you with loss of hearing, you will no longer be able to hear bats or where your arrows land; this effect will last for two moves.
	f. If you walk into a room which inflicts you with loss of smell, you will no longer be able to smell the Wumpi if they are close by; this effect will last for two moves.
2. The Wumpi cannot be lifted by the bats and cannot be killed by the pit.
3. You are able to move or shoot, but only into one of the three rooms that are adjacent to you at any point in time. 
4. You are armed with five arrows at the start of the game; if you run out of arrows and the wumpus is still alive, it is game over for you. 
5. Firing an arrow close enough to a Wumpus and missing it may cause it to move to one of its adjacent rooms; it is possible that it will move to your current location and kill you.
6. A single extra arrow has been left behind by a previous hunter; finidng it will add one arrow to your stash.
