Removed debugging notifications
Updated error messages to be precise: 
	specifies if user enters text when int was expected and prompts to re-enter (note, they are taken to re-enter the room now, and no longer have the choice to re-enter move or shoot)
	specifies if user enters a room that is not adjacent and prompts to re-enter (note, they are taken to re-enter the room now, and no longer have the choice to re-enter move or shoot)
	The same was done for arrows as well
	specifies if user does not enter "move" or "shoot" at the beginning, and allows them to re-enter their 	choice


Report wise:
